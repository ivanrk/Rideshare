# Rideshare
<b>Web app for travel sharing</b>

<p>As a passenger you can apply to trips; as a driver you can accept or reject applications from passengers<br/>
These actions are available:<br/>
	- if the trip is upcoming and is not over<br/>
	- if there are available seats in the car</p>

<p>At the end both sides can leave a review for each other.<br/>
Reviews are visible on user's profile page.<br/>
They form your average rating.<br/>
Reviews are unique for each user, you can rate a specific user only once even if you travel multiple times together.</p>
<p>To organize a trip, you need to add a car to your profile.</p>
